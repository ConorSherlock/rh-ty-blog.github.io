Today we first played an icebreaker game to get to know more people and feel more comfortable. Then we went on a tour of the offices which was interesting to see all the facilities and environment the programmers work in. After that we had a talk about the history of red hat which was quite interesting. we had our first break then in which I got to know a few of the lads as we played pool and mariokart. After our break we had a talk on health and safety. we then got to go on an early lunch in which we played a small bit more pool and mariokart. After lunch we had an interesting talk on agile and scrum followed by a practical to put what we had learned into practice. We did this by using mr potato heads as our product. We were split into three teams and assigned a product owner each. The product owner gave us a theme and we had to work together to create a potato head based on the Theme. We finished the day off by getting ourselves set up on the laptops. I enjoyed today and am looking forward to the week ahead.

Today, we first started by doing our stand up reveiwing what we did the previous day. After this we logged onto github and writing our blog for Monday. We learned how to add pictures aswell to our blog and commit these changes. Once we had finished that we started learning about Python through a presentation which was quite interesting. We then got to put what we had learned into practice by logging onto terminal and writing some simple code. We started very simple and then after a while we made a rock paper scissors game. We then had another presentation on hacking passwords and we got to go onto a website and follow step by step how to hack passwords by using their hash number. Once we were finished with that we finished for the day. I enjoyed the day as we learnt lots of new skills.
